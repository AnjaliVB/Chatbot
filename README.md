# Chatbot
Final Year Project<br><br>
_**Chatbot is a computer application that is used to have conversation with a human user, usually over the internet.**_
<br>

The bot has a user interface through which the user asks/queries the bot and it matches the input with the data it has and outputs the relevant response if present. If the query is invalid, the bot replies that it does not understand the input and asks to query it again.

This bot is associated with a static website (dummy) showing information about a software company, which is developed using bootstrap.

The backend is built using Python's NLTK module while its user interface is built using tkinter module of Python.<br>
